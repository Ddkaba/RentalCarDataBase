The goal of the project is to develop an information system using specified data structures and algorithms to optimize information processing in a specific subject area.
The project will include a study of basic data structures and algorithms, tools for implementing the functionality of the information system.
This work will allow us to move on to the application of the studied concepts in the specific case of creating an information system for customer service in a car rental agency.
Subject area – customer service in a car rental agency;
Hashing method – closed hashing with hashing slope;
Sorting method – extraction;
List view – linear bidirectional;
The tree traversal method is reverse;
The algorithm for searching a word in a text is direct.
